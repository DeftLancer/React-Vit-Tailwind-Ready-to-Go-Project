# React + Vite + Tailwind

This is a pre setup project that provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. Tailwind CSS is added as well.

Essential Directories are also added.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

-   [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
-   [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
